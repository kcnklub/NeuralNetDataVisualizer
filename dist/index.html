                &emsp;&emsp;I am going to make a 3 layer neural network and allow the user to walk through the steps of the neural network. This is a learning tool for people that are wanting to learn about neural
                networks and back propagation. Neural networks are based off the structure of the human brain. Nodes represent the neurons in the brain.
                Moving the data are like synapses firing in the brain moving electrical signals from neuron to neuron.
                <br /><br />
                &emsp;&emsp;
                In 1943, Warren McCulloch, a neurophysiologist and mathematician, described how neurons in the brain might work and modeled a simple electrical circuit based on that model.
                So, neural networks have been around for a long time. Although just recently have we had the ability to compute large networks on a variety of tasks.
                Recent developments in neural networks have brought about a ton of applications. From speech recognition to style transfer of video and image files.
                I have linked a video of style transfer on a video file. It is one of the coolest things I have seen done with neural networks. I was not involved in the contents of the video.
                Just a really cool video showcasing the use of neural networks.
                In this demo I show a simple neural network compute the truth table of a set of numbers.

                <h2>Explained</h2>
                <h4>Input Layer</h4>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;The input Layer is the input that the user will give to the neural network.</p>
                <h4>Output Layer</h4>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;The output layer is the neural networks guess at the answer that you are wanting it to guess.</p>
                <h4>Expected Output</h4>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;It is as Simple as it sounds the output that you want the neural network guess. The type of learning that is being used here is supervised because we as the user know what answer that we want to see from the neural network.
                Another example of supervised learning is training a network to learn to classify apples and oranges. You will show the network images of apples and oranges and let it guess, then tell it whether it was right or wrong.
                So that it is able to update its weights accordingly.</p>
                <h4>Syn0 and Syn1</h4>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;This are our weights of our network. At the start of training these are just random numbers, but as we train our network will update these values using the process of back propagation. Back propagation is the
                method of using the error from the guess from the network to update the weights. Starting from the last layer of weights and working backwards to the first layer of weights.</p>
                <h4>Error</h4>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;The percent error that of our guess compared to the actual value that we are looking for.</p>
                <h4>Delta</h4>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Delta represents the error of the network scaled by confidence. It is almost identical to error, but very confident errors are muted.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, I made this web app as learning tool to understand how data flows through a basic neural network. This neural network lets the user see how feeding forward data
                    and back propagation works by showing the weights of the network update as the network repeatedly trains. It also shows the use of two different activation function that are popular
                    for neural networks. Neural networks are a very powerful tool and are the driving force of advances in image and voice recognition. I want to give credit to iamtrask for a very good
                    tutorial that inspired me to make this web application. If you want to see that article take a look <a href="https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/">here</a>.
