            &emsp;&emsp;I am going to make a 3 layer neural network and allow the user to step through the steps of the neural network as a learning tool for people that are wanting to learn about neural
            networks and back propagation. Neural networks are based off the structure of the human brain. Nodes represent the neurons in the brain.
            Moving the data are like synapses firing in the brain moving electrical signals from neuron to neuron.
            <br /><br />
            &emsp;&emsp;
            In 1943, Warren McCulloch, a neurophysiologist and mathematician, described how neurons in the brain might work and modeled a simple electrical circuit based on that model.
            So, neural networks have been around for a long time. Although just recently have we had the ability to compute large networks on a variety of tasks.
            Recent developments in neural nets have brought about a ton of applications of them. From speech recognition to style transfer of video and image files.
            In this demo I show a simple neural network compute the XOR value of a set of numbers.
